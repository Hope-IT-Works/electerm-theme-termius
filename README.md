## How to install
Download the files from the [release](https://github.com/Hope-IT-Works/electerm-theme-termius/releases/latest). Import the `.ini`-file as new theme. Change the background to the `.png`-file.

I use these background parameters:
| Opacity | Blur | Brightness | Grayscale | Contrast |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0.25 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

Additionally, you can install the original font: [`Source Code Pro SemiBold`](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Source%20Code%20Pro:wght@600)
